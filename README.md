# guess-the-card
A WIP game I'm working on

# Rules:
Random numbers between 0 and 9 will be added to a random spot on 4x4 board

The numbers can't appear more than twice and won't be visible to the player

The player must reveal the entirety of the board by entering the board coordinates of the board. If the numbers corresponding to the coordinates are the same, then they will be revealed to the player

The game continues until the board is completely revealed
